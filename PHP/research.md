## What Are the Three Main Error Types in PHP?

### Types of Errors in PHP

In PHP, errors can be classified into three main categories:

1. **Syntax Errors**
    - Caused by mistakes in the code syntax.
    - Occur when the PHP parser encounters an unexpected or incorrect statement or expression.
    - Example: Missing semicolon, misspelled function name.

2. **Runtime Errors**
    - Occur during the execution of the code.
    - Caused by incorrect function arguments, incorrect variable types, or memory-related issues.
    - Example: Division by zero, undefined function calls, array out-of-bounds errors.

3. **Logical Errors**
    - Code executes without syntax errors but does not behave as expected.
    - Caused by incorrect or incomplete logic in the code.

## Echo vs Print

- `echo` has **no return value**, while `print` has a return value of `1`, so it can be used in expressions.
- `echo` can take multiple parameters (rare usage), while `print` can take only one argument.
- `echo` is **faster** than `print`.

## Case Sensitivity in PHP

- PHP is a **case-sensitive** language.
- Variables, function names, and identifiers **distinguish** between uppercase and lowercase.
- Example: `$hello` and `$Hello` are two different variables.
